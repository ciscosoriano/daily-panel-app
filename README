#  Science Quiz Android App

## Synopsis

Name:  Science Quiz

Video: <https://vimeo.com/256995185>

This is an Android quiz application with 12 questions relating to science facts and principles.

The questions and answers with 4 images were developed by the Pew Research Center. <http://www.pewresearch.org/quiz/science-knowledge/>

Eight additional images were selected and added to the quiz.


## Code Description

Each screen of the quiz, except for the splash and end screens, uses an Activity and Intent to capture the questions and answers along with displaying the radio buttons and images.  Variables of score and question numbers are passed through with intents.

Below are 3 screen shots with the splash screen, an unanswered quiz screen and a quiz which has been answered:
